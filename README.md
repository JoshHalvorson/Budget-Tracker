# Budget-Tracker

I wanted to challenge myself and make a small functional app from a UI mockup.

I got the design from [here](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/expense-tracking-app-5de7a32b-4871-4cf7-8b33-e363cf6ba809), credit to them,
I thought it was a really cool design!

This is not a play store ready app, or really a "usable" app, its not meant to be. It tracks budgets but not across months and doesnt save a history. I wanted to make a bite sized app with a great looking UI that has the potential to be a fully fledged app if I were to continue working on it. 

Also, thanks for checking it out!

## Libraries

I used Coroutines, RoomDB, Material Design Library, and stetho for some light db debugging.
