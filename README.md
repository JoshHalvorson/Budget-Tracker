# Budget-Tracker

I wanted to challenge myself and make a small functional app from a UI mockup.

I got the design from [here](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/expense-tracking-app-5de7a32b-4871-4cf7-8b33-e363cf6ba809), credit to them,
I thought it was a really cool design!

## Libraries

I used Coroutines, RoomDB, Material Design Library, and stetho for some light db debugging.
